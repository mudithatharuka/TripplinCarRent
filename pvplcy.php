If you submit your email address, We use it to deliver the information to you. We always permit you to unsubscribe or opt out of future emails.

<br>
<br>
<h2>External Use</h2>

<p>Except as otherwise set forth below, We do not sell, rent, trade, license or otherwise disclose your specific personal information or financial information to anyone.</p>

We also will release personal information where disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights, enforce our Terms and Conditions or other agreements, or to protect ourselves or others. For example, We may share information to reduce the risk of fraud or if someone uses or attempts to use this Site for illegal reasons or to commit fraud.</p>
<br>

<p>We may share non-personal information (such as the number of daily visitors to a particular web page, or the size of an order placed on a certain date) with third parties such as advertising partners. This information does not directly personally identify you or any user.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<br>

<p>We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>
<br>

<h2>Opt Out/Corrections</h2>

<br>
<br>
